# Zabbix-Scripts
Place to put Zabbix Scripts

Please create a new directory at the top level for any new projects.

Inside each directory should be a readme that lists all the scripts in that directory, and the location of their deployment.  Do this because we have no other way of tracking the deployment of these scripts.

Example:

|Program|Server|Location|
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|`Script1.ps1`|Indy-PRM-1|Not yet deployed|
|`Script1.ps1`|Indy-PRM-2|`D:\InstalledApplications\ZabbixScripts\Script1.ps1`|
